# ZeroRansomware Project 

### By Salma Valencia

## Steps:

You can modify this line of code to establish where to begin the encryption:
char path[] = "C:\\Users";

It has a very simple encryption (shifting ascii values). However, feel free to change the "encrypt" function.

## Use these commands in the cmd to compile and run:
```
filepath> g++ ZeroRansomware.cpp -o ZeroRansomware
filepath> ZeroRansomware
```
